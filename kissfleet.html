        <h1 class="titlep">Fleet training</h1>
        <p class="subhe">Fleet Trainer Course</p>
        <p>hilst many Fleet Driver Training Courses require you to take a week off work, our course is in modular
            form. This allows you to complete the course, which is a minimum of 30 hours in as little as one week or
            could be completed in 10 weeks or more. What is most important is our guarantee of unlimited training to
            ensure you feel competent to coach professional drivers</p>
        <p class="subhe">Client Centered Development</p>
        <p>
            Although this is the latest industry buzzword, at KISS we have been training our driving instructors to
            teach this way for over ten years. It isn’t difficult to do, it just requires us to ask questions and
            not tell drivers what to do. With the right training aids (which we supply) and a little practice you
            can dramatically generate more business for yourself.<br>
            Our Fleet Driver Training Course will identify and focus on your needs and our Fleet Trainers will
            deliver as much one to one as you need. Some of the classroom training needed will be delivered online
            so you can attend from the comfort of your home. Some will take place in groups to help you develop your
            skills.<br>
            We do ask you to do some preparation work however we do supply the training aides required to make this
            an easy process e.g. write a brief report. If our Trainers identify any additional training needs please
            take advantage of the extra help and guidance offered.
        </p>
        <p class="subhe">Course Options</p>
        <p>
            You can join our rolling Fleet Driver Trainer Course at any time and the only restriction is that you
            must complete all five units within one year of passing the Theory Test. This allows for as much
            training as you need and ensures you will qualify and be able to generate income as a Fleet driver
            trainer.</p>
        <p class="subhe">Course Completion</p>
        <p>Once you have completed the five units you can apply to the DSA enter the Fleet Register of trainers.
            More importantly, to be able to sell your services into businesses you need to be confident in your
            knowledge and skills required to deliver the results an organisation needs.
        </p>
        <p class="subhe">Course Fee Options</p>
        <p>We are confident that our fleet driver trainer programme will deliver the training you need to become a
            fleet trainer. Set aside a few hours a week to attend one of our weekly fleet trainer courses run
            throughout the South East which will offer you so much more training than other courses.
        </p>
        <p>We believe in simple agreements without any hidden surprises so you won’t be blinded by mountains of
            small print and, once you have signed up you will receive all your course material and begin to study
            and train straight away.</p>
        <p class="subhe">Option 1:£850</p>
        <p>With this option you simply pay the full amount up front and benefit from a discounted course fee. This
            includes the DSA Fleet Trainers Licence fee.</p>
        <p class="subhe">Option 2:£630</p>
        <p>Pay in three equal instalments of £210, the first instalment should be when you sign up, the second after
            two months and the third on completion.
        </p>
